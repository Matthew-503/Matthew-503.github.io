title: Create delightful React File Structures for projects
---

# Introduction

React is renowned for being agnostic about file and directory organization. How should you structure the files and directories in your applications?

Because React has not established any standards, its flexibility makes it challenging to build a project using React. Well, there is no one "right" way, but I tried a lot of different approaches. I eventually came up with a solution that I'm pretty pleased with.

In this blog post, I'll outline three distinct folder structures in this article that can apply to projects of all sizes. The complexity of these structures is listed from the simplest to the most complicated.

However, depending on the size of your project, a more straightforward approach might be preferable.

Before I get going on the various folder structures, I want to make one point. Only the files and folders included in the src folder will be addressed. There is no appropriate, universal structure utilizing outside of the src folder because your files will be very project-specific and rely substantially on the libraries you use.

# My Priorities

Let's begin by discussing my priorities and the areas I've optimised for.

First and foremost, I want to make it easy to import components. The ideal situation would be able to write this:

![Alt text](../images/priority01.png)

Next: when I'm working in my IDE, I dont want to be flooded with `index.js` files. To be fair, most editors will now include the parent directory when multiple index.js files are open at once, but then each tab takes up way more space. I've worked on projects where the top bar looked like this:

![Alt text](../images/priority02.png)

My goal, is to have nice, organized, clear component file names, like this:

![Alt text](../images/priority03.png)

Finally, in terms of organization, I prefer that things be arranged by function rather than feature. I want a "components" directory, a "hooks" directory, a "helpers" directory, and so on.

Sometimes, larger and more complex components will have a bunch of associated files coming with them. These include:

- "Sub-components", smaller component parts used exculsively by their respective main component

- Custom hooks

- Helper functions

- Constants or data shared between components and its associated files

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
