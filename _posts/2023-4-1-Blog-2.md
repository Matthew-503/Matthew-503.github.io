title: React File Structures

Time for you to build a delightful and organized React project file structure? Hop in and see what you've missed!

# Introduction

React is renowned for being agnostic about file and directory organization. How should you structure the files and directories in your applications?

Because React has not established any standards, its flexibility makes it challenging to build a project using React. Well, there is no one "right" way, but I tried a lot of different approaches. I eventually came up with a solution that I'm pretty pleased with.

In this blog post, I'll outline three distinct folder structures in this article that can apply to projects of all sizes. The complexity of these structures is listed from the simplest to the most complicated.

However, depending on the size of your project, a more straightforward approach might be preferable.

Before I get going on the various folder structures, I want to make one point. Only the files and folders included in the src folder will be addressed. There is no appropriate, universal structure utilizing outside of the src folder because your files will be very project-specific and rely substantially on the libraries you use.

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```

# My Priorities

Let's begin by discussing my priorities and the areas I've optimised for.

First and foremost, I want to make it easy to import components. The ideal situation would be able to write this:

Next: when I'm working in my IDE, I dont want to be flooded with `index.js` files. To be fair, most editors will now include the parent directory when multiple index.js files are open at once, but then each tab takes up way more space. I've worked on projects where the top bar looked like this:

![Alt text](../images/blog1/priority02.png)

My goal, is to have nice, organized, clear component file names, like this:

![Alt text](../images/blog1/priority03.png)

Finally, in terms of organization, I prefer that things be arranged by function rather than feature. I want a "components" directory, a "hooks" directory, a "helpers" directory, and so on.

Sometimes, larger and more complex components will have a bunch of associated files coming with them. These include:

- "Sub-components", smaller component parts used exculsively by their respective main component

- Custom hooks

- Helper functions

- Constants or data shared between components and its associated files

To make things clear, let's talk about the `FileViewer` component as an example. Here are the files created specifically for this component:

- `FileViewer.js` â€” the main component

- `FileConent,js` â€” the component that renders the contents of a file, with syntax highlighting

- `Sidebar.js` â€” the list of files and directories on the side that is used to explore the whole page

- `Directory.js` â€” the collapsible directory, used in the sidebar

- `File.js` â€” an individual file, used in the sidebar

- `FileViewer.helpers.js` â€” one of the helper functions to help traverse the tree and assist in managing the expanding / collapsing functionality

All of these documents ought to be concealed, out of sight. They should only be shown to me when I'm working on the FileViewer component since I only need them then.

# The Implementation

Let's now discuss how my implementation responds to these priorities.

## Components

Here is an example component that has every file and directory needed to achieve my objectives:

![Alt text](../images/blog1/priority04.png)

The majority of these files are those that were previously described and required for the `FileViewer` component. Just `index.js` is an exception. That's new.

If we look inside, we willÂ discover something a little odd:

![Alt text](../images/blog1/priority05.png)

In essence, this is aÂ redirection. We will redirect to the `FileViewer.js` file in the same directory when we attempt to import this file. This component's actual code locates in `FileViewer.js`.

**Why not just leave the code in index.js?** The `index.js` files will eventually fill up our editor. I don't need that.

**Why is this file even there?** That makes imports easier. Simply put, we'd have to manually choose the file by navigating to the component directory and doing something like this:

![Alt text](../images/blog1/priority06.png)

Ideally, with out `index.js` following, we can shorten it to just:

![Alt text](../images/blog1/priority07.png)

**Why does this work?** `FileViewer` is a directory, so the bundler will look for files like `index.js`, `index.ts`, etc. when we endeavor to import a directory. `My-Website.com` will automatically try to load `index.html` as per a convention carried over from web servers, saving the user from having to type `my-Website.com/index.html`.

I believe that conceptualizing this in terms of an HTTP request is helpful. The bundler will detect that we are importing a directory when we import `src/components/FileViewer`, and it will immediately load `index.js`. The `index.js` performs a figurative 301 REDIRECT to `src/components/FileViewer/FileViewer.js`.

Although it may seem overly engineered, I like this structure because it meets all my requirements.

## Hooks

I'll keep a hook with that component if it's unique to that component. What happens, though, if the hook is generic and intended to be used by a variety of components?

I have roughly 10 all-purpose, reusable hooks in this blog. The `src/hooks` directory has a collection of them. These are a few instances:

![Alt text](../images/blog1/priority08.png)

There's 2 things i'll like to mention here:

1. I add .hook to the end of each hook name to ensure clarity.

2. I use kebab-case instead of camelCase for better visibility.

There's no specific reasoning for making these decisions. I just like the way it looks. ðŸ˜„

It's perfectly acceptable to name your hooks useThing.js instead of use-thing.hook.js! The convention you choose to employ for your file names is irrelevant.

## Helpers

What if I have a function that, while not directly linked to a component, will assist me in achieving some project goal?

For instance, this blog offers several categories for blog posts, such as `React`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. I have a few functions that allow me to retrieve the formatted or "pretty" name for the category or to arrange the categories by the number of posts. Everything of it belongs to a category. `src/helpers` contain the `helpers.js` file.

Occasionally, a function will begin in a file specific to a component, such as `FileViewer/FileViewer.helpers.js`. But I soon realized I required it in several places, converting it to `src/helpers`.

## Utils

There's some explanation needed, bear with me as I go on.

Many developers consider "helpers" and "utils" as synonyms, but I see them as separate concepts.

A helper is anything that is customized to a project. Sharing helpers between projects is typically not a good idea; the `category.helpers.js` functions are basically just useful for this blog.

A utility is a genericÂ function that performs a specific purpose. To me,Â almost every function in the `lodash` library is a utility.

Here's an example of a tool I frequently use. It selects an item at random from an array:

![Alt text](../images/blog1/priority09.png)
I have a `utils.js` file consisting of these kinds of utility functions.

Why not use a well-known utility library like `lodash`? If it's not something I can easily build myself, I will. Yet no utility library will have all of the utilities I require.

For example, this one moves the user's pointer within a text input:

![Alt text](../images/blog1/priority10.png)

Also, this utility calculates the separation between two points on a cartesian plane (which is a question that surprisingly frequently arises in projects with complex animations):

![Alt text](../images/blog1/priority11.png)

## Constants

Finally, I have a `constants.js` file. Constants used by the whole app are being stored in this file. While the majority of them are style-related (such as colors, font sizes, and breakpoints), I also save public keys and other "app data" in this location.

I carry these tools from project to project and they are located in src/utils.js. The file could beÂ copied and pasted when I start a new project. To maintain uniformity across projects, I could publish it through NPM, but that would cause a great deal of friction, and I haven't found that to be a worthwhile trade-off. Perhaps in the future, but not yet.

## Pages

The concept of pages is theÂ one thing that is absent here.

This portion depends on the tools you use thus leaving it off. I don't have pages when using a tool like `create-react-app`. Instead, everything is a component. When utilizing `Next.js`, however, I have `/src/pages`, which contain top-level components that outline the general organization of each route.

# Conclusion

There's really no clear-cut definition for your file structure. I'm simply sharing my practice to those that seek improvement. However, if you find a practise that works for you, stick with it. React is adaptable to our applications, allowing you to be creative while also being efficient.
