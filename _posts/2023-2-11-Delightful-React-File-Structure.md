title: Create a delightful React File Structure for projects
---

React is famously unopinionated when it comes to file/directory structure. How should you structure the files and directories in your applications?

Well, there is no one “right” way, but I've tried lots of different approaches in the 7+ years I've been using React, and I've iterated my way to a solution I'm really happy with.

In this blog post, I'll share the structure I use across all my current projects, including this blog and my custom course platform.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
